# Java implementation of the pjlink protocol
The [Pjlink](https://pjlink.jbmia.or.jp/english/) protocol is used by many projectors to be controlled over TPC and UDP connections.
This project implements authentication with projectors and sends commands to perform actions such turning on/off or switch inputs over the network.
